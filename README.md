# Kruskal_algorithm_with_visualisation

## Description
This algorithm was made using C# and as a Visual Forms application to provide possibility of calculation **min** or **max** spanning tree of the given *graph*.

## Instruction
After starting program you will be able to see area for drawing your graph.  
Simply use **left** button click of your mouse to place graph **vertex** and after creating several vertexes by holding **Ctrl** key and clicking on 2 vertexes you can create connection between them - **edge**.  
Afterwards choose **min** or **max** option and program will calculate desired spanning tree of your graph.
